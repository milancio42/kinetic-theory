# Kinetic Theory of Matter and Light

Abstract:

Following the path paved by Ludwig Boltzmann we present a theory
explaining the phenomena described by General Relativity (GR) and Quantum
Mechanics (QM) using only Newton's laws of motion and few additional
assumptions. We show that both GR and QM are incomplete and therefore cannot be united in their present form.
We explain the origin of the speed of light, the gravitational
constant, the Planck constant and the fine structure constant. We
also present simple experiments to test the new theory.

## A summary of differences with the current state of physics

1. During Big Bang the original particle of pure mass hit the universe wall and broke up - forming Aether.
1. As Aether vibrates due to the orignal collision, larger particles tend to agglomerate. This acoustic agglomeration is known as the strong force. 
   Residual strong force is analogical to Bjerknes force. 
1. Charge is not a point. It is an agglomerate of Aether particles oscillating harmonically in an odd mode.
   Its oscillation creates acoustic field whose sound pressure gradient is what we know as electric field.
1. An electron does not have lower mass than proton, it has higher intrinsic acceleration.
1. The electric field does not exert a force on a charge, it only aligns its intrinsic acceleration.
   The alignment arises spontaneously as in Huygens Pendulums or among pedestrians on Millennium Bridge.
1. Magnetic field does not represent the real physical field, but a mathematical construct describing the doppler shift of electric field.
1. Light does not arise becasue changing electric field generates changing magnetic field and vice versa. It is a modulated wave of agglomerate's electric field.
1. The speed of light is the speed of sound of Aether.
   It is not constant, but finite in absolute units.
   It only appears constant because the oscillation of agglomerates and the speed of sound are related.
1. Gravity is not the space curvature but the gradient of the speed of sound of Aether caused by the gradient of Aether particle sizes, mostly caused by the acoustic agglomeration.
1. Photoelectric effect is not caused by photons colliding with electrons but by light causing the alignment of electrons' intrinsic acceleration so they gain energy.
1. Electron does not have an intrinsic angular momentum. Its spin magnetic moment arises from its forward helical path, which is either clockwise or anti-clockwise.
1. Compton effect does not arise from photons hitting electrons but from the retardation of alignment of electron's intrinsic acceleration vector with the electric field vector of incident light.
1. As photons do not exist, they cannot be entangled in the first place. This can be proved by violating CHSH inequality even for provably non entangled light.
   Consequently, all the entanglement experiments done on electrons which involved photons for detection are invalid.
1. Quarks are just deformations of an agglomerate due to its oscillation. They are hard to detect in electron as it is larger and more fragile than proton.
1. Beta decay is a breakdown of agglomerates which are not in stable equilibrium. The ejected small chunk (W/Z boson) continues to agglomerate until it reaches the electron's resonant frequency.
   The conservation of charge comes from the conservation of momentum.
1. Higgs boson is an insignificant chunk of proton agglomerate.
1. Gravitational waves are not detectable over large distance as entropy levels Aether particle size gradient. LIGO probably detected low frequency Aether sound waves.
1. Supermassive black holes are not holes. The largest Aether particles tend to be in the center of galaxies. A sound cannot pass a large group of such particles.
   Their size gradient creates enormous gravitational field. 
1. Dark matter does not exist. The galaxy rotation anomaly is caused by uneven particle size gradient caused by passing stars. The speed of gravitational field is slower further from the agglomerate.
1. Dark energy does not exist. It is the effect of increase of speed of sound of Aether as its particles tend to break down over time. 
1. "Elementary" particles zoo is a consequence of agglomerates' many possible oscillation frequencies and modes.
1. It is useless to hit protons against each other. We should instead concentrate to learn to manipulate the intrinsic acceleration of charges.
