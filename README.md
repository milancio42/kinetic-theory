# Kinetic Theory of Matter and Light

Abstract:

Following the path paved by Ludwig Boltzmann we present a theory
explaining the phenomena described by General Relativity (GR) and Quantum
Mechanics (QM) using only Newton's laws of motion and few additional
assumptions. We show that both GR and QM are incomplete and therefore cannot be united in their present form.
We explain the origin of the speed of light, the gravitational
constant, the Planck constant and the fine structure constant. We
also present simple experiments to test the new theory.
