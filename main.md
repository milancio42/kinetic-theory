# Kinetic Theory of Matter and Light

To understand a system is to understand its mechanics. That is to understand the parts composing the system and their interactions.
At the lowest level these interactions must follow Newton's laws of motion, else we would soon arrive at some contradiction.

To understand, say, Quantum Mechanics, we must explain why the energy of atoms can change only in discreet steps. It is not sufficient just to state that it is like that.
If such understanding does not derive from the Newton's laws of motion, then it is incomplete.

When physicists studied the behavior of electrons and protons in an external electric field, they have noticed their trajectories are curved differently.
The logical explanation was that they must have different mass. The
other possible explanations, like the electric force is not symmetric
or the magnitude of their charges is not equal were quite trivial
to exclude.
Yet, it was already known at that time that what we consider as mass does not behave like the classical "Newtonian" mass. 
And so if the mass is not **the** mass, our interpretation of electron and proton trajectories **may** be wrong.
There may be something else going on under the hood.

What could it be?

Let's suppose there is another explanation of electron and proton tajectories. What if a charge had an intrisic acceleration which is randomly oriented in space. 
The electric field does not apply a force on the charge, it merely aligns its intrinsic acceleration.
Then it is no longer purely random, but has a net orientation - the charge accelerates prevalently in a given direction. 
Stronger the alignment, stronger the net acceleration.

This is desirable because if we can show that the intrinsic acceleration of a charge decreases with its speed (with respect to the distance weighted majority of other charges), then we can
substitute a vague concept of the relativistic mass with a clear concept of acceleration.
Of course, we are then forced to show how the intrinsic acceleration could emerge and this is precisely what we are going to do in the next sections. 

We will then show how the Quantum Mechanics and the General Relativity emerge from our simple concept.
However, predictions of our model differs in several aspects from the current Quantum Mechanics and we have proposed simple experiments to test this.

We start with the following postulates:

1. *There exist only an empty space and homogenous instances of matter.*

1. *An instance of matter preserve its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless it collides with other instances of matter.*

1. *The sum of the product of volume and velocity of all instances of matter remain constant and equal to zero.*
    Velocity is intended with respect to an arbitrary point in space.

1. *The sum of the product of volume and the square of velocity of all instances of matter also remain constant and is greater than zero.*

1. *Universe is a finite container made of matter filled with finite number of other instances of matter called bits.*

1. *Bits are not divisible.*

1. *Bits have spherical shape. Their radius is random and follows the exponential distribution.*

1. *A mean free path of the median bit is in the order of its diameter.*

## The Origin of Speed of Sound

From the postulates it follows that bit collisions are elastic. Since they are homogeneous and indivisible, they do not posess any elastic energy.
All energy of Universe is kinetic.

Bits thus form an ideal gas and we will call it **Aether**.

We choose to set the units of matter density to 1. This way the **classical mass** is equal the volume of bits.
Here we distinguish the classical mass from the relativistic mass which we will define later.

As bits have kinetic energy, Aether has a temperature and so it must have also a speed of sound:
$$c^2 = \frac{\gamma T}{\langle m \rangle }$$

Where:
- $c$ - speed of sound
- $\gamma$ - specific heat ratio - bits, being rigid spheres, have 3 (translational) degrees of freedom, resulting in $\gamma=1+\frac{2}{3}=\frac{5}{3}$
- $T$ - temperature of Aether
- $\langle m \rangle$ - average classical mass of bits

## The Origin of Macroscopic Inertia

We suppose, at the beginning of Universe, the spatial distribution of bits was uniform. Aether was at the state of maximum entropy.
It might seem counter-intuitive that any structure could evolve from such state. It would seem that the second law of thermodynamics forbids it.
Yet the law of entropy has an equal counterpart - the phenomenon of spontaneous synchronization, which applies to bound systems when its elements are loosly coupled.
An example of this are pedestrians on Millenium bridge in London. Hundreds of them, each with its own gait, all ended up synchonized.
Or Huygens pendulums, nails in the shaking box, fireflies in the forest, neurons in the brain and many many others. 
Let's exammine if this phenomenon could apply also to the bits of Aether.

Soon afte the beginning, the biggest bits were slowed down due to the drag force of Aether (the author is well aware of Michelson-Morley experiment, as we will see it has nothing to do with this).
Larger bits constantly collides with smaller bits, resulting in their Brownian motion. 
There must be a certain bit size where the bit's Brownian motion is not significantly slowed down by the drag force. This must be towards the lower end of size distribution.
We will call it the limit size and bits as limit bits.

The limit bits wander in 3D random walk. If few of them get close enough to each other, they start to
attract each other due to Bernoulli's hydrodynamic effect. If the
bits are too small, they are part of the fluid and Bernoulli's effect disappears.
If they are too big, the Brownian motion is too slow and Bernoulli's effect vanishes too.
Also, for the limit bits, the Bernoulli's effect disappears
if the they touch themeselves, 
so they must be in dynamich equilibrium positions between Bernoulli's 
effect and Brownian motion. Over time, other limit bits get attracted too and they start to form **agglomerates**.

They are then loosely coupled and loosely coupled bits start to behave like the pedestrians
on the Millenium bridge. They will synchronize their motion and the agglomerate starts to oscillate.

So far we have three effects in play, the Brownian motion, the Bernoulli's effect and the spontaneous oscillation effect.  
The first two effects are constructive, they work to make the agglomerate as big as possible. The last one is destructive, it works to rip the agglomerate apart due to the resonance.

The agglomeration effect does not depend on the agglomerate's size as the attractive force is caused by Bernoulli's effect between individual bits.
We consider the mean attractive force of the agglomeration effect to be constant.

However, the destructive oscillation effect *does* depend on the
agglomerate's size. Furthermore, it must be in equilibrium with the
agglomeration effect, else the agglomerate would either continue
to grow or some chunk of it would fly away.

$$\langle F_{agg} \rangle = m a = \rho r^3  \omega^2 r= \rho \omega^2r^4 = const$$

$$\omega = \frac{const}{r^2}$$

Where:
- $F_{agg}$ - mean agglomeration force
- $m$ - classical mass of the agglomerate
- $a$ - average acceleration of agglomerate’s bits
- $\rho$ - density of the agglomerate
- $r$ - radius of the agglomerate (assuming spherical shape)
- $\omega$ - angular frequency of the agglomerate

We can see that if the mean agglomeration effect is constant, then the angular frequency of the agglomerate is inversely proportional to the square of its radius.
This is a very important finding and we will use it later when we describe the electric field.

Soon after the creation of Universe, the first agglomerates started
to emerge. Their oscillation then created the **acoustic field** in Aether.

As a consequence, the primordial agglomerates
started to influence each other with their acoustic fields.
Once again we have the synchronization phenomenon in place.
Over time, the agglomerates must have synchronized themeselves to the same
resonant frequency and thus to the same size.

What do we know about the mode of their oscillation?

The lowest mode is the first one, but it is not stable because it is spherically symmetric and the acoustic waves from other agglomerates are generally not sphericaly symmetric.
Therefore it would transform into the second mode and if the universe was 2D plane, then this would be the stable mode with the lowest energy.
But the universe is 3D space and so the second mode transforms further into the third mode, which is the stable mode with the lowest energy.

But the third mode has higher energy and thus also higher frequency than the first mode. We have shown before that the frequency and the size of an agglomerate are related.
When the first generation agglomerates shifted from the first to the third mode, they must have ejected small chunks of themselves away.

The ejected chunks, at first, had very little internal oscillation. They continued to agglomerate and could have even outgrow the first agglomerates before their limit bits synchronized.
Therefore the second generation of agglomerates emerged, this time with lower resonant frequency. During their synchronization they ejected another set of chunks, but this time we have two types of
agglomerates with different resonant frequencies and so the second ejected chunks ended up either as the first or the second type of agglomerate.

When this process finished, the majority of limit bits were bound in agglomerates. The remaining free limit bits in Aether were rare enough to prevent the spontaneous agglomeration.

What can we say about the motion of agglomerates in Aether?

Even in equilibrium, the two types of agglomerates, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, continue to agglomerate but they will eject a tiny chunks when they grow too much.
These "equilibrium chunks" are much smaller than those we have described before. They have subcritical diameter so they are not able to create agglomerates of their own (especially because the 
concentration of limit bits in Aether is much lower at this point).

As the agglomerates oscillate in the third mode, by our third postulate, after each ejection of chunks the agglomerate
gains velocity in the opposite direction of the ejected chunks. It
receives more limit bits from that direction, resulting in slightly
less oscillation energy on that side. Therefore in the second
iteration the chunks will be ejected roughly in the same direction
as in the first cycle. We say roughly because the agglomerate is
subject to the acoustic field of Aether that is not completely
coherent. The motion of the agglomerate resembles a drunk jellyfish.

The magnitude of the acceleration ultimately depends on the rate of the agglomeration, which depends on the surface of the agglomerate and that depends on the square of its radius.
Thus, the intrinsic acceleration of an agglomerate is inversely proportional to its frequency, which is called the **Compton frequency**.
**The Compton wavelength** is a lenght the sound travels in Aether during one oscillation cycle of an agglomerate.

What we perceive as inertial mass in the macro world is therefore not the mass in the classical sense. It is an **apparent mass**.

## The Origin of Charge, Planck Constant and Fine Structure Constant

An agglomerate oscillating harmonically in an odd mode is called **Elementary Charge**.
Sound pressure of its acoustic field is called **Electromagnetic (EM) potential**. Its gradient is therefore **EM field**.

EM field does not exert a force on a charge in a classical sense. It only aligns the intrinsic acceleration of a charge so it is no longer purely random but has a net orientation.
Stronger the alignment, stronger the **net** acceleration. 

The agglomerates can be classified based on their frequency and mode of oscillation:

|frequency\mode|odd|even|
|---|---|---|
|**harmonic**|charge|semicharge|
|**non harmonic**|semineutral|neutral|

**semicharge** influences other charges but itself is not influenced.
**semineutral** does not influence outher charges, but itself can be influenced (only magnetically though).

The agglomerate’s acoustic power is constant:

$$I_{acc} \propto \omega^2 r^2 \propto \frac{const}{r^2}$$

$$W_{acc} = I_{acc} r^2 = const$$

Where:
- $I_{acc}$ - acoustic intensity at the agglomerate’s surface
- $W_{acc}$ - agglomerate’s acoustic power due to its oscillation
- $\omega$ - angular frequency of the agglomerate
- $r$ - radius of the agglomerate (assuming spherical shape)

Constant mean agglomeration force leads to constant charge’s acoustic power which leads to **constant divergence of EM field**.

The agglomeration force is called the Strong Force. Its magnitude is as follows:
$$\langle F_{agg} \rangle = \frac{\hbar c}{r_{EMlimit} ^ 2}$$

Where:
- $F_{agg}$ - mean agglomeration force
- $\hbar$ - reduced Planck constant
- $c$ - speed of sound of Aether (speed of light)
- $r_{EMlimit}$ - radius below which the proton’s EM field does not exist. Around 1 fm - which is slightly bigger than proton’s radius due to its oscillation.

The Planck constant does not have a physical meaning on its own. 
Together with the Aether’s speed of sound and the proton’s EM limit radius determine the magnitude of the agglomeration force a.k.a. the “strong force”.

Let’s recall a charge accelerates because it ejects chunks in the opposite direction.
A tiny part of the oscillation momentum is transferred to the forward momentum per unit of time.
This fraction, normalised for the apparent mass, is often called the Fine Structure Constant $\alpha$.

The EM force at the proton’s EM limit is therefore:
$$\langle F_{agg} \rangle = \frac{\alpha \hbar c}{r_{EMlimit} ^ 2}$$

Where:
- $F_{agg}$ - mean agglomeration force
- $\alpha$ - fine structure constant
- $\hbar$ - reduced Planck constant
- $c$ - speed of sound of Aether (speed of light)
- $r_{EMlimit}$ - radius below which the proton’s EM field does not exist. Around 1 fm - which is slightly bigger than proton’s radius due to its oscillation.

When a charge moves relative to majority of other charges, it perceives other charges' acoustic field as Doppler shifted.
If the speed is close to the speed of sound of Aether, the Doppler shift is significant and it start to influence the oscillation frequency of the charge.
Faster it goes, higher the perceived frequency of other charges and, due to the synchronization, higher the oscillation frequency of the charge.
But higher oscillation frequency results in lower radius of the charge - it shrinks with the relative speed.
We have shown the intrinsic acceleration depends on the radius of a charge - faster it goes, smaller it is and slower the acceleration.

If we could hypothetically align the charge so it constantly accelerates in one direction, its intrinsic acceleration would gradually slow down. There is a limit to its speed,
which is the speed of sound of Aether. A charge can never reach it as its size would shrink to zero.

Charges moving relative to each other see each other in retarded positions due to finite speed of sound. Their acoustic field is less intense than if they were "stationary".
This effect is called **Magnetism**.

Harmonically accelerating charge creates modulated waves in its acoustic field. The transverse modulated waves are called light.
No need of solid state Aether as imagined by Maxwell. Even air can have transverse **modulated** waves.

This can be tested by the following experiment:

![](/assets/images/aether_experiment.001.jpeg)

Where:
- E - source of electron generated signal
- P - source of proton generated signal
- D - detector

Experiment description:

On the left side we have two sources of EM waves. One uses harmonically accelerated electrons while the second one uses protons.
They should generate EM waves of different wavelength so they are distinguishable.

The acoustic field of proton has higher Compton frequency that that of an electron (not to be confused with the generated EM waves which are just modulated waves).
Therefore its speed of propagation in vaccum is not **exactly** the same as that of electron.
We expect the difference to be very small and it could be measurable only after travelling a very long distance. Perhaps Earth - Mars should be sufficient.

We should see two different speeds of light - one for light generated by electrons and one for light generated by protons.

The classical physicists failed to recognize that light is just a modulated wave and that the speed of light is just the speed of the electric field.
This was their first mistake.

The second mistake was to think that an accelerated charge loses its kinetic energy because it radiates EM waves.
It is due to the relativistic effect that the electron in cyclotron feels the centripetal force slightly retarded. Therefore it is not perpendicular to its trajectory, but shifted backwards, causing its slowdown.
This will be important when we review the Quantum Mechanics.

## The Origin of Quantum Behaviour

The key to unlock the strangeness of Quantum Mechanics is the intrinsic acceleration of agglomerates.

### Stern-Gerlach

A lone charge moves through space in randomly curved trajectories as its intrinsic acceleration is randomly oriented.
Its classical gyroscopic moment has a negligible effect as it is the surrounding Aether what determines its motion.
Therefore a charge in an external magnetic field is free to align its trajectory with the field.
The trajectory then becomes helical and creates a magnetic moment which can have only two directions (clockwise or anticlockwise) and is called the Spin Magnetic Moment.

As the Spin Magnetic Moment does not arise from the rotation of a charge around its axis but from its forward helical movement, it exists only for the axis parallel to the forward motion.
Also, it does not exist until the forward helical motion is forced by the external magnetic field.
This is the explanation of **Stern-Gerlach experiment**.

Interestingly, a semineutral agglomerate can also move in helical path, creating the magnetic moment. It does not oscillate harmonicaly so it cannot align itself to other charge's field, but its path can
still be influenced magnetically.

The radius of the agglomerate’s forward helical motion is called **de Broglie Wavelength**.

### Schrödinger equation

An electron has higher intrinsic acceleration than proton so it “flies” around it in closed helical paths. 
The path is blurred further from the proton as the intrinsic acceleration is less aligned.
*Harmonic paths* form orbits modelled by the **Schrödinger equation**.

### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

As agglomerates have the randomly oriented intrinsic acceleration, their immediate momentum is also random.
Therefore if we know their position, we can only observe their immediate momentum which tells us nothing about the net direction nor the speed.

To know that we need to know the average momentum, which requires to observe them over longer time. But then we will lose the information about their precise position. 

This is the explanation of **Heisenberg Uncertainty "Principle"**.

### Pauli's Exclusion Principle

The electron's average intrinsic acceleration is never fully perpendicular to proton but it is slightly off due to the finite speed of sound.
This relativistic effect causes the electron to lose its average momentum over time until it is zero.

But its immediate momentum is never zero and so it has always non-zero orbital energy.

The radius of electron's helical path is much greater than proton’s diameter so they cannot collide naturally.

This is the basis of **Pauli’s Exclusion “Principle”**.

### Absorption and Emission lines and Photons
The electron orbiting proton always radiates light.
Based on its path it can be either harmonic or non harmonic.

The harmonic light is emitted by electrons in harmonic orbits.
The non harmonic light is emitted by electrons passing between harmonic orbits or when in the ground orbit.

A harmonic light of the correct frequency can resonate the electron which will accumulate orbital energy.
The accumulation continues until the electron reaches higher harmonic orbital corresponding to different frequency.
There it cannot gain any more energy from the original light as they are out of phase.
This explain the **discreet absorption lines**.

The intensity of light only determines the speed of the energy accumulation.
With the low intensity light it takes long enough time that we can distinguish the distinct clicks on the “photon” detector.
The concept of **photon is just an illusion**.

An electron in a higher harmonic orbital loses its average momentum over time.
When it passes between harmonic orbitals, it generates non harmonic light which is indistinguishable from the background noise. 

This explains the **discreet emission lines**.

### Bremmstrahlung

The non harmonic light can be also generated by bremsstrahlung.
It comes in short wave trains and it has a property that its electric field does not sum up to zero over time - as in the harmonic light.
Therefore also this light, albeit non harmonic, can cause an electron to accumulate enough energy to fly away from the nucleus.

Such non harmonic light does not have a proper wavelength as it is not periodic. 
Thanks to Fourier analysis we know it can be approximated by a series of harmonic waves with “virtual wavelengths”.
For that, important is the shape of the gradient in time, not the amplitude.
High gradient and low gradient light at par intensity correspond to different wavelengths.

### Compton Effect

When a charge is subject to the electric field from incident light, it tends to align with it.
During the alignment, its acceleration vector rotates, so the scattered light appears to have longer wavelength during this phase as a function of cosine.
The magnitude depends on the charge’s original orientation and its oscillation period (when it is aligned contrary to the field, then it takes the whole period).
This is the explanation of the Compton effect.

Arthur Compton actually discovered the electron’s intrinsic oscillation frequency.

### Anoumalous Photon Entanglement

As light is a pure wave, photons do not exist, and so they cannot be entangled.
This can be verified with a very simple experiment:

![](/assets/images/entanglement_setup.001.jpeg)

Where:
- S - source of "entangled photons"
- RSCP - rotating single channel polariser
- TCP - two channel polariser
- D - detector

Experiment description:

On each side we have added an additional rotating polariser between the source and the TCP.
Their orientation offset matches that of the “entangled photons” and must be kept while they are rotating - when one “photon” passes so must the other.
They will make n whole turns before each TCP switch, where n is integer > 0.

According to the current QM we will not detect any entanglement as that is lost on the rotating polarisers.
But in reality we will detect it because light as a pure wave passes TCP in both directions, only with differing intensities.
The low intensity light takes longer time to eject electrons resulting in distinct clicks in detectors, therefore they are discarded as non entangled.
Only the light with the correct polarisation carries enough intensity to cause simultaneous clicks in the detectors.

Light, as a modulated acoustic wave, interferes with the positive sign in two-slit experiments.
Agglomerates interfere too but with their own acoustic waves reflected from the other slit.  Therefore they interfere with the negative sign.
This is the simple explanation of a simple physical rule Feynman was looking for in his lectures.

## The Origin of Gravity

The Secondary Acoustic Field traps larger bits in the vicinity of an agglomerate, creating a gradient of the average bit size.
The average size of Aether bits is lower further from the agglomerate, causing the absolute speed of sound to be faster.

Due to Huygen’s principle light will bend in such gradient.

The vibrating agglomerates will accelerate down the gradient - towards the higher concentration of limit bits.
The sound travels slower there. The agglomerate oscillation is also slower there, therefore also the relative time passes slower.

The average bit size in a given space is the **Gravitational Potential**.
The Gravitational Field is its gradient.

The Gravitational constant $G$ represents the strength of this gradient. 
We can expect the effect of the secondary acoustic field on the bit gradient to be fairly low, especially at such short distances as is the diameter of agglomerates.
This explains why gravity is relatively weak.

In one case however it is not so weak.

### Supermassive Black Holes

So far we ignored the evolution of larger bits. We suppose that even those are subject to the agglomeration effect, although over a huge time horizon.
Over (rather long) time very large bits may form local concentrations. We speculate that these are the seeds of galaxies.

The huge bits in their centers create enormous gradient, much steeper than what could ever by achieved by the normal agglomerates.
The acoustic field created by charges could not penetrate a large group of such bits, making them perfectly opaque to light.
The center of a galaxy would appear as the **supermassive black hole**.

This additional gradient is present also further from the center creating the additional gravitational field.
This could explain the **dark matter** and even the Arp's high redshift quasars.

## Various
The agglomerates have many names based on their frequency and mode of oscillation - proton, neutron, mesons, electron, muon, tau …

Higgs Boson is just a tiny, non significant chunk of proton formed after the collision with another agglomerate.
