# Kinetic Theory of Matter and Light

## The Origin of Speed of Light

Existence is the ability to interact.

Only an instance of matter (henceforth particle) can interact with other particles.

The empty space does not interact.

Particles are homogeneous, elastic and divisible.

Universe is a finite container made of matter filled with particles.
The volume of universe is greater than the volume of all particles inside.

At the beginning there was only one particle moving towards the universe wall.

Absolute units:

- a unit of length is the diameter of Universe.
- a unit of time is the time it took the original particle to cross the universe.
- a unit of classical mass is the volume of a particle.

The product of the classical mass and velocity of all particles in universe is constant.

At certain point in time the original particle hit the Universe wall and broke up. 
The resulting particles continued to break up against the wall and against each other.
The process was slowing down as the particles got smaller and less fragile.

As a result universe is filled with many particles of various shapes and sizes, following the Boltzmann exponential law.
It resembles gas and we will call it Aether.

Aether has a temperature and so it has a speed of sound:
$$c^2 = \frac{\gamma T}{\langle m \rangle }$$

Where:
- $c$ - speed of sound
- $\gamma$ - specific heat ratio - particles have 12 degrees of freedom (3 translational, 3 rotational and 2 vibrational for each axis) resulting in $\gamma=1+\frac{2}{12}=\frac{7}{6}$
- $T$ - temperature of Aether
- $\langle m \rangle$ - average classical mass of particles

The average size of particles tends to decrease over time.
As collisions are elastic, the speed of sound must increase over time.

A sound in Aether produced a long time ago has its wavelength longer now.
Longer it is, earlier it was produced.
This is often called the “Dark Energy”.

## The Origin of Inertia

When the original particle hit the universe wall, it caused it to vibrate.
In turn, the wall transferred the vibration back to Aether when it was formed - creating the background acoustic field (**BAF**).

Larger particles under the influence of BAF start to agglomerate - the “force” which keeps them together is the Agglomeration force.
Its mean strength does not depend on the agglomerate’s size.

The agglomeration force keeps particles in dynamic equilibrium positions.
For small displacements it grows linearly.
Agglomerates thus can behave as harmonic oscillators.

Agglomerates continue to grow until the agglomeration force is no longer sufficient to keep the oscillating particles bound.
This happens when they reach one of the BAF resonant frequencies.
They are then in equilibrium.

When in equilibrium, agglomerates continue to grow but their growth is offset by ejecting small chunks due to oscillation.
By Newton’s Third law, agglomerates will accelerate in the opposite direction of the ejected chunks.

Larger agglomerates eject disproportionally larger chunks as the mean agglomeration force does not depend on the agglomerate’s size - resulting in higher intrinsic acceleration.

The agglomerate’s size is a function of BAF frequencies.
The intrinsic acceleration is therefore quantised.

Larger agglomerates accelerate faster not because they have lower mass, but because they have higher intrinsic acceleration.
What we perceive as mass in the macro world is therefore not the mass in the classical sense. It is an **apparent mass**.

## The Origin of Charge, Planck Constant and Fine Structure Constant

When the agglomerate oscillates in an even mode, the chunks are ejected in pairs in opposite directions, resulting in no net acceleration.
When it oscillates in an odd mode, it can have a net acceleration.

As the agglomerate oscillates it creates its own secondary acoustic field (**SAF**).

When a harmonically oscillating agglomerate is influenced by a harmonic SAF of another agglomerate, it will tend to align to the field.
The alignment arises spontaneously as in Huygens Pendulums or among pedestrians on Millennium Bridge.

If the first agglomerate is oscillating in an odd mode, it will start to accelerate away or towards the second agglomerate.

An agglomerate oscillating harmonically in an odd mode is called **Elementary Charge**.
The peak pressure of its acoustic field is called **Electromagnetic (EM) potential**. Its gradient is therefore **EM field**.

EM field does not exert a force on a charge in a classical sense. It only aligns the intrinsic acceleration of a charge so it is no longer purely random but has a net orientation.
Stronger the alignment, stronger the **net** acceleration. 

The relation of the agglomerate’s angular frequency to its size:

$$\langle F_{agg} \rangle = m a = \rho r^3  \omega^2 r= \rho \omega^2r^4 = const$$

$$\omega = \frac{const}{r^2}$$

Where:
- $F_{agg}$ - mean agglomeration force
- $m$ - classical mass of the agglomerate
- $a$ - average acceleration of agglomerate’s particles
- $\rho$ - density of the agglomerate
- $r$ - radius of the agglomerate (assuming spherical shape)
- $\omega$ - angular frequency of the agglomerate

The agglomerate’s acoustic power is constant:

$$I_{acc} \propto \omega^2 r^2 \propto \frac{const}{r^2}$$

$$W_{acc} = I_{acc} r^2 = const$$

Where:
- $I_{acc}$ - acoustic intensity at the agglomerate’s surface
- $W_{acc}$ - agglomerate’s acoustic power due to its oscillation
- $\omega$ - angular frequency of the agglomerate
- $r$ - radius of the agglomerate (assuming spherical shape)

Constant mean agglomeration force leads to constant charge’s acoustic power which leads to **constant divergence of EM field**.

The agglomeration force is often called the Strong Force. Its magnitude is as follows:
$$\langle F_{agg} \rangle = \frac{\hbar c}{r_{limit} ^ 2}$$

Where:
- $F_{agg}$ - mean agglomeration force
- $\hbar$ - reduced Planck constant
- $c$ - speed of sound of Aether (speed of light)
- $r_{limit}$ - radius below which the proton’s EM field does not exist. Around 1 fm - which is slightly bigger than proton’s radius due to its oscillation.

The Planck constant does not have a physical meaning on its own. 
Together with the Aether’s speed of sound and the proton’s Em limit radius determine the magnitude of the agglomeration force a.k.a. the “strong force”.

Let’s recall a charge accelerates becaus it ejects chunks in the opposite direction.
A tiny part of the agglomeration momentum is transferred to the forward momentum per unit of time.
This fraction, normalised for the apparent mass, is often called the Fine Structure Constant $\alpha$.

The EM force at the proton’s EM limit is therefore:
$$\langle F_{agg} \rangle = \frac{\alpha \hbar c}{r_{limit} ^ 2}$$

Where:
- $F_{agg}$ - mean agglomeration force
- $\alpha$ - fine structure constant
- $\hbar$ - reduced Planck constant
- $c$ - speed of sound of Aether (speed of light)
- $r_{limit}$ - radius below which the proton’s EM field does not exist. Around 1 fm - which is slightly bigger than proton’s radius due to its oscillation.


Charges moving relative to each other will have their EM field Doppler shifted due to finite speed of sound. This is called Magnetism.

Harmonically accelerating charge creates modulated waves in its acoustic field. The transverse modulated waves are called light.
No need of solid state Aether as imagined by Maxwell. Even air can have transverse **modulated** waves.

The classical physicists failed to recognise that light is just a modulated wave and that the speed of light is just the speed of the electric field.
This was their first mistake.

The second mistake was to think that an accelerated charge loses its kinetic energy because it radiates EM waves.
It is due to the relativistic effect that the electron in cyclotron feels the centripetal force slightly retarded. Therefore it is not perpendicular to its trajectory, but shifted backwards, causing its slowdown.

## The Origin of Quantum Behaviour

The key to unlock the strangeness of Quantum Mechanics is the intrinsic acceleration of agglomerates.

A lone charge moves through space in randomly curved trajectories as its intrinsic acceleration is randomly oriented.
Its classical gyroscopic moment has a negligible effect as it is the surrounding Aether what determines its motion.
Therefore a charge in an external magnetic field is free to align its trajectory with the field.
The trajectory then becomes helical and creates a magnetic moment which can have only two directions (clockwise or anticlockwise) and is called the Spin Magnetic Moment.

As the Spin Magnetic Moment does not arise from the rotation of a charge around its axis but from its forward helical movement, it exists only for the axis parallel to the forward motion.
Also, it does not exist until the forward helical motion is forced by the external magnetic field.
This is the explanation of **Stern-Gerlach experiment**.

The radius of the agglomerate’s forward helical motion is often called **de Broglie Wavelength**.

An electron has higher intrinsic acceleration than proton so it “flies” around it in closed helical paths. 
The path is blurred further from the proton as the intrinsic acceleration is less aligned.
Harmonic paths form orbits modelled by the **Schrödinger equation**.

The electron cannot fall to the proton because it constantly accelerates so it has always a non-zero orbital energy.
Also the radius of its helical path is much greater than proton’s diameter so they cannot collide naturally.
This is the basis of **Pauli’s Exclusion “Principle”**.

The electron orbiting proton always radiates light.
Based on its path it can be either harmonic or non harmonic.

The harmonic light is emitted by electrons in harmonic orbits.
The non harmonic light is emitted by electrons passing between harmonic orbits or when in the ground orbit.

A harmonic light of the correct frequency can resonate the electron which will accumulate orbital energy.
The accumulation continues until the electron reaches higher harmonic orbital corresponding to different frequency.
There it cannot gain any more energy from the original light as they are out of phase.
This explain the **discreet absorption lines**.

The intensity of light only determines the speed of the energy accumulation.
With the low intensity light it takes long enough time that we can distinguish the distinct clicks on the “photon” detector.
The concept of **photon is just an illusion**.

Due the relativistic effect and the randomness of Aether vibrations, an electron in a higher harmonic orbital tends to lose its kinetic energy and fall to the ground level.
When it passes between harmonic orbitals, it generates non harmonic light which is indistinguishable from the background noise. 
This explains the discreet emission lines.

The non harmonic light can be also generated by bremsstrahlung.
It comes in short wave trains and it has a property that its electric field does not sum up to zero over time - as in the harmonic light.
Therefore also this light, albeit non harmonic, can accumulate enough energy in an electron to eject it from the nucleus.

Such non harmonic light does not have a proper wavelength as it is not periodic. 
Thanks to Fourier analysis we know it can be approximated by a series of harmonic waves with “virtual wavelengths”.
For that, important is the shape of the gradient in time, not the amplitude.
High gradient and low gradient light at par intensity correspond to different wavelengths.

When a charge is subject to the electric field from incident light, it tends to align with it.
During the alignment, it does not accelerate at full extent, so the scattered light appears to have longer wavelength during this phase.
The magnitude depends on the charge’s original orientation and its oscillation period (when it is aligned contrary to the field, then it takes the whole period).
This is the explanation of the Compton effect.

The real significance of the Arthur Compton’s experiment is the discovery of the electron’s intrinsic oscillation frequency.

### Anoumalous Photon Entanglement

As light is a pure wave, photons do not exist, and so they cannot be entangled.
This can be verified with a very simple experiment:

![](/assets/images/entanglement_setup.001.jpeg)

Where:
- S - source of "entangled photons"
- RSCP - rotating single channel polariser
- TCP - two channel polariser
- D - detector

Experiment description:

On each side we have added an additional rotating polariser between the source and the TCP.
Their orientation offset matches that of the “entangled photons” and must be kept while they are rotating - when one “photon” passes so must the other.
They will make n whole turns before each TCP switch, where n is integer > 0.

According to the current QM we will not detect any entanglement as that is lost on the rotating polarisers.
But in reality we will detect it because light as a pure wave passes TCP in both directions, only with differing intensities.
The low intensity light takes longer time to eject electrons resulting in distinct clicks in detectors, therefore they are discarded as non entangled.
Only the light with the correct polarisation carries enough intensity to cause simultaneous clicks in the detectors.

Light, as a modulated acoustic wave, interferes with the positive sign in two-slit experiments.
Agglomerates interfere too but with their own acoustic waves reflected from the other slit.  Therefore they interfere with the negative sign.
This is the simple explanation of a simple physical rule Feynman was looking for in his lectures.

## The Origin of Relativity

A charge cannot directly observe the diameter of universe nor the absolute time we defined earlier. 
It can only observe the wavelength and gradient of other charges’ acoustic field and compare it to its own oscillation.

Apparent units:

- apparent time is the number of charge’s oscillations.
- apparent length is the number of charge’s wavelengths.

The speed of sound expressed in apparent length and time appears constant.
A charge cannot see finer resolution than this, therefore also length and time are quantised.

From the universe’s point of view the speed of sound is finite but variable.
From the charge’s point of view it is finite and constant.

Moving charges, due to the finiteness of the speed of sound, see each other’s acoustic field distorted and out of phase with their own oscillation - resulting in apparent length contraction and time dilation.

Length contraction and time dilation affects the intrinsic acceleration, thus distorting also the apparent mass.
This is the basis of Special Relativity.

The Secondary Acoustic Field traps larger particles in the vicinity of an agglomerate, creating a gradient of the average particle size.
The average size of Aether particles is lower further from the agglomerate, causing the absolute speed of sound to be faster.

Due to Huygen’s principle light will bend in such gradient.
The vibrating agglomerates will accelerate down the gradient where they vibrate more slowly - distorting the apparent length, time and mass.

The average particle size in a given space is the Gravitational Potential.
The Gravitational Field is its gradient.

The Gravitational Field tends to align with the Secondary Acoustic Field.
The alignment is slower further from the source b/c the acoustic field is weaker.

A star moving through Aether will have its gravitational field distorted behind it - like wakes appearing behind a broom sweeping sand.

Other stars travelling behind will be affected by this - as if they were attracted by some additional **dark matter**. 

## Various
The agglomerates have many names based on their frequency and mode of oscillation - proton, neutron, mesons, electron, muon, tau …

Higgs Boson is just a tiny, non significant chunk of proton formed after the collision with another agglomerate.
