# Anomalous Photon Entanglement

Abstract:
A novel experiment is proposed to test the detection loophole in the quantum entanglement.


For about a century, it is largly accepted that light is composed of photons - objects that cannot be imagined. They behave as both, waves and particles at the same time.
One of the consequences of this, as observed by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen[^EPR], is the existence of the effect nowadays known as the quantum entanglement (QE).
It originated as a demonstration that the quantum mechanics must be incomplete. However, in 1964 John Stewart Bell devised a way how to test it[^Bell]. 
To the surprise of many physicists, including Bell himself, photons do seem to "know" of each other instantly[^Aspect]. 
Some researchers questioned the validity of the result pointing to possible loopholes 
in the experiment[^Pearle]. For example, we may be "cherry picking" only favorable particles - resulting in the detection loophole.

While there have been claims that all the loopholes have been closed, we will examine one which has not yet been closed - the nature of light itself.
The QE has a property that it gets lost after the photons have passed the polarizer. This is because their polarity is resolved and so they cannot continue to be entangled.

Therefore we have designed an adjusted photon entanglement experiment, where we have added two additional polarizers between the source of entangled photons and the dual channel polarizers - described in the picture:

Where:
- S - source of "entangled photons"
- RSCP - rotating single channel polariser
- TCP - two channel polariser
- D - detector

The RSCP orientation offset matches that of the entangled photons and must be kept while they are rotating - when one “photon” passes so must the other.
They will make n whole turns before each TCP switch, where n is integer > 0.

If light is composed of photons, then their polarization gets
resolved after they pass the inserted RSCP and so they will get
disentangled. The non-entangled photons then pass the traditional
TCP which should result in the non-violation of CHSH inequality.

On the other hand, if we still detect the violation of CHSH inequality,
then it is a proof that there is no entanglement happening. At least
not in this setup. However, to the best knowledge of the author, all the
QE experiments so far in some way used light to detect the CHSH
inequality violation. Therefore all of them could be potentially
invalid. 

We must not forget that the QE is a direct consequence of wave-particle duality of light. 
If QE is just an illusion, so could be the wave-particle duality.

The best explanation for this result is that light waves
passing BBO crystal are coherent but have many polarizations. Waves
with the favourable polarization with respect to the final polarizers
(TCPs) can deliver the necessary energy for an electron to escape
the nucleus more quickly. Therefore there is higher probability that
the time difference between escaped electrons in both detectors is
is small enough to be considered as a coincidence.

The unfavourably polarized waves are rejected as non coincidences.

If this is the result, then the whole nature of light must be reviewed.
